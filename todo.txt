- Classes now capped at 5 per class.
- New waiting list feature.
- Waiting list capped at 20 potential clients.
- Integrate waiting list into Manage Bookings button - new dropdown button feature.
   "Booking Details", "Waiting List"
Details: First name, Surname, Contact Number, Email and Timestamp of creation.
- Full set of CRUD actions for the waiting list.
- iPad integration - create icons etc for bookmarks.
- New retina friendly icons.
- New frontend javascript logic with spinning loader before each page load (prevent content area from starting at the top)
- So content area must now be display: none;
- Perhaps try and clean up the view logic that displays "What's on for today?"
- Order details box in "New Booking" is confusing.
- "There are no present bookings saved to the system." for booking/waiting list page.
- Fix disabled footer links like wtf.
- Fix responsive glitch. Perhaps box-sizing: border-box;?
- In "What's on for today?", make each name a link that links to the  specific entry on the booking details page. So
 each entry on the booking details page now needs an id "#id" to target in the URL.
- Grey background on the hover of a name in "What's on for today?"
- New icons for actions in manage bookings. Add edit functionality on top of the existing cancel feature.
- Feeling a nice dark herokuy color scheme for the waiting list page. We'll see.
